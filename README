# Talk-SLP

Talk-SLP converts enriched.md files to slp slide show files which can then be converted to beamer-tex slideshow files.
It allows to write a presentation from perspective of the speech than rather from the visual presentation which is
often done and leads to the wrong focus, i.e., the slides are the central element of transporting information instead
of the speaker.

Thus, talk-slp allows to write the speech in talking points or normal text and the semi-automatically generate slides
from it.

The tool is in its early stages, it is written in C for the fun of it (most likely it would be easier to write it in
Python or Perl).
